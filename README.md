# DATA 3401 Spring 2025 Lab 1
**Name:** Stephanie Esparza <br>
**Email:** sxe2965@mavs.uta.edu <br>
**Major:** Data Science - Biology <br>
**Experience:** I've participated in a fair amount of beginner coding/tech programs in the past, but didn't practice enough afterwards to retain most of what I learned. But, this does mean that I'm fairly familiar with the basics of programming foundations, and shouldn't struggle too much on picking back up on some things, at least I hope. <br>
**Hobby:** As of late, I've really been enjoying practicing the guitar more consistently.
